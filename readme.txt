Steps to run the Chat Application code.

1. Compile and run Server.java first.

2. Compile and run Client.java. (The user needs to run the Client.java file for every chat client. For example, for chat 1 and chat 2, run the Client.java file twice.)

3. To send a message from chat 1 to chat 0, the user needs to send the message in this format : <message>#<chat name>
   Chat names are maintained on an index. Thus, the chats will be named "chat 0", "chat 1" and so on, starting from "chat 0".
   If the user on chat 1 needs to send a message "hi" to a user on chat 0, he/she will write "hi#chat 0" (without quotes).
